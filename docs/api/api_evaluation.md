| **SLA availability** | 99.9% | 99.5% | 99.95% |

## Recommendation for Project Implementation

Based on our evaluation, we recommend using **OpenTransport API** as our primary data source with the following justifications:

1. **Balance of coverage and accuracy**: While TransitMaster has better accuracy, the wider coverage of OpenTransport is more valuable for our demo application.

2. **Sufficient update frequency**: The 15-30 second update interval meets our real-time display requirements.

3. **Cost-effective**: The free tier should be sufficient for development, with reasonable scaling costs.

4. **Developer-friendly**: Good documentation and community support will speed up implementation.

5. **Webhook capability**: Will allow us to implement efficient real-time updates rather than constant polling.

### Fallback Strategy

We recommend implementing **CityTransit API** as a fallback data source in case of OpenTransport API outages or exceeded rate limits. This dual-API approach will provide better reliability for our application.

## Implementation Requirements

To handle the volume of data required (100,000+ records), we will need to implement:

1. **Efficient caching strategy**: Using memory cache for active data and disk cache for historical patterns
2. **Request throttling**: To stay within API limits while maintaining data freshness
3. **Data retention policies**: To manage storage requirements for historical data
4. **Fault tolerance**: Circuit breaker pattern to handle API unavailability
5. **Background processing**: Thread pool for handling data updates without blocking UI
