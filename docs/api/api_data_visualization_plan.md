# API Data Visualization Planning

## Real-Time Public Transport Tracker - UI Components

This document outlines how the API data will be visualized in our .NET MAUI application to fulfill the project requirements.

### 1. Map Visualization

The transport vehicles retrieved from the API will be displayed on an interactive map with the following features:

- **Vehicle Icons**: Different icons for buses, trains, trams, etc.
- **Color Coding**: Routes shown in different colors based on status (on time, delayed, etc.)
- **Clustering**: Automatic clustering of vehicles in congested areas
- **Real-time Updates**: Smooth animations for vehicle movements
- **Selection**: Tap to view detailed vehicle information

### 2. Arrival Time Predictions

Arrival time data will be visualized using:

- **Timeline Charts**: Visual representation of scheduled vs. actual arrival times
- **Countdown Displays**: Real-time updating ETA for selected vehicles
- **Delay Indicators**: Color-coded visualization of delay severity

### 3. Transport Density Visualization

Analysis of the 100,000+ dataset using PLINQ will enable:

- **Heatmaps**: Show areas with high transport density
- **Time-based Analysis**: Historical patterns throughout the day
- **Route Load Charts**: Visualization of passenger loads on different routes

### 4. Route Details

Each route will have a detailed view showing:

- **Stop List**: All stops along the route with arrival predictions
- **Vehicle Distribution**: Visual representation of vehicles currently on the route
- **Schedule Adherence**: Stats on whether the route is running on time

### 5. Search Results Visualization

Search functionality will include:

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Instant UI updates as filters are applied using PLINQ
- **Results Grouping**: By route, vehicle type, or proximity
- **Sort Options**: By ETA, distance, or alphabetical

## Multi-threading Considerations for UI

To maintain UI responsiveness while processing large datasets:

1. **Background Processing**: All API calls and data processing will happen on background threads
2. **UI Thread Safety**: Updates to UI will be marshaled to the main thread
3. **Progress Indicators**: Loading animations during intensive operations
4. **Incremental Updates**: UI will update incrementally as data becomes available
5. **Virtualization**: Only render visible items in lists to handle large datasets

## Implementation Notes

- Map control will use Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Maps
- Charts will use Microcharts.Maui library
- Animations will use the MAUI Animation API
- Background processing will use Task Parallel Library
- Large dataset processing will use PLINQ
